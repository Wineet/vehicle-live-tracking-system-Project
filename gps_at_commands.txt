*** AT Command Routine ***

AT+CGPSPWR=? --> GPS Mode  returns the current value of GPS Power Control PIN 

Turn On GPS
AT+CGPSPWR=1 --> Turn on GPS power supply


GPS Reset Mode (COLD /HOT/WARM)



**** Get GPS Location ***
TA returns the current successful GPS location info. This command should be executed after the GPS locating successfully.

GNSS AT command is as follows: 
AT+CGNSPWRGNSS --> power controlAT+CGNSSEQ Define the last NMEA sentence that parsed 
AT+CGNSINF GNSS navigation information parsed from NMEA sentences 
AT+CGNSURC GNSS navigation, GEO-fence and speed alarm URC report control 
AT+CGNSCMD Send command to GNSS NEMA
AT+CGNSTST Send data received from GNSS to AT UART


Time to first fix (TTFF) is a measure of the time required for a GPS navigation device to acquire satellite signals and navigation data, and calculate a position solution (called a fix).


AT+CGNSURC for updating URC on fix periodicity
