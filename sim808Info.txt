****SIM 808 Info *****

TCP/IP protocol and extended TCP/IP AT commands which are very useful for data transfer
applications. For details about TCP/IP applications

GPS Bluetooth GSM engine available.

**** Power Modes *****

Sleep : In sleep mode, the module can still receive paging message and SMS
Idle: Software is active. Module registered to the GSM network, and the module is ready to communicate.


Power Down: Normal power down by sending the AT command “AT+CPOWD=1” or using the PWRKEY.
The power management unit shuts down the power supply for the baseband part of the
module, and only the power supply for the RTC is remained. Software is not active. The
serial port is not accessible. Power supply (connected to VBAT) remains applied.

Minumum Modem Func: AT command “AT+CFUN” can be used to set the module to a minimum functionality mode
without removing the power supply. In this mode, the RF part of the module will not work or
the SIM card will not be accessible, or both RF part and SIM card will be closed, and the
serial port is still accessible. The power consumption in this mode is lower than normal
mode.

 AT+CFUN=0: minimum functionality.
 AT+CFUN=1: full functionality (default).
 AT+CFUN=4: flight mode (disable RF function).


When the GPS function is shut off, user can control SIM808 module to enter or exit the sleep mode
(AT+CSCLK=1) by DTR signal. When DTR is in high level and without interrupt (on air and hardware such as
GPIO interrupt or data in serial port), SIM808 will enter sleep mode automatically. In this mode, SIM808 can still
receive paging or SMS from network but the serial port is not accessible.
Note: For SIM808, it requests to set AT command “AT+CSCLK=1” and ensure DTR at high level to enable the sleep mode ; the
default value is 0, which can not make the module to enter sleep mode.

sleep wakeup:

When SIM808 is in sleep mode (AT+CSCLK=1), the following methods can wake up the module:
1 Pull down DTR pin. The serial port will be active after DTR pin is pulled to low level for about 50ms.
2 Receive a voice or data call from network.
3 Receive a SMS from network.
4 Receive external interrupt
5 Charge VBUS pin

*****************************
I/O Information

PWRKEY should be pulled low at least 1 second and then released to power on/down the module.

Programmable GPIO5, GPIO6 (pin no 43&44) Pull down on reset
The output voltage level of the GPIO can be set by the AT command “AT+SGPIO”. The input voltage level of the GPIO can also be read by the AT command “AT+ SGPIO”

NETLIGHT pin No. 50 Output --> Network status
STATUS pin No. 49   Output --> Power on status 

“AT+CADC” to read the voltage value Max range 2.8v prceision 20mV
ADC1 ADC2 Pin No. 23 & 24 (10 bit ADC)

PWM output frequency varies from 0 to 2KHz.Two 7-bit unsigned binary parameters are used for the output
period and for the duty cycle. The AT command “AT + SPWM” is used to set the output period and duty cycle of
the PWM.

PWM1 PWM2  Pin No.42 & 41

******************************

Module Power up & communication

When power on procedure is completed, SIM808 will send following URC to indicate that the module is ready to
operate at fixed baud rate.

URC --> "RDY"

This URC does not appear when autobauding function is active.

User can use AT command “AT+IPR=x” to set a fixed baud rate and save the configuration to non-volatile flash memory.
After the configuration is saved as fixed baud rate, the Code “RDY” should be received from the serial port every time when
SIM808 is powered on.

The default setting is autobauding.

--> Auto Baud Rate
AT+IPR=0
OK
--> Setting to 115200
AT+IPR=115200

The DTE serial port must be set at 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.


SIM808 also has a RESET pin (pin 16) used to reset the module. This function is used as an emergency reset
only when AT command “AT+CPOWD=1” and the POWER_ON pin has no effect. User can pull the RESET pin
to ground, then the module will rese

Restrictions of autobauding operation:
The DTE serial port must be set at 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.
The URC such as "RDY", "+CFUN: 1" and "+CPIN: READY” will not be reported.

64ms On/ 800ms Off SIM808 not registered the network
64ms On/ 3000ms Off SIM808 registered to the network

Parameter Saving Mode

For the purposes of the present document, the following syntactical definitions apply:
NO_SAVE: The parameter of the current AT command will be lost if module is rebooted or current AT command doesn't have parameter.

AUTO_SAVE: The parameter of the current AT command will be kept in NVRAM automatically, and it won't be lost if module is rebooted.

AT&W_SAVE: The parameter of the current AT command will be kept in NVRAM by sending the command of “AT&W.”


*********************************

Data terminal equipment (DTE) ex: terminal, computer, printer
data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE)
URC (Unsolicited Result Code)

When DCE powers on with autobauding enabled, firstly, user must send character “A” or “a” to
synchronize the baud rate. It is recommended to send “AT” until DTE receives the “OK” response, which
means DTE and DCE are correctly synchronized.


The DTE serial port must be set at 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.


***********************************

GPS Mode

Active mode: GPS is active as a GPS receiver. The GPS engine will automatically acquire and track GPS
satellites.
Power down mode: The GPS engine will be set into this mode by sending AT command “AT+CGPSPWR=0”. In
this mode the internal power supply for GPS will be shutdown, and the current consumption is very low. The last
position, current time and ephemeris data will be stored in the GSM host memory.

User can power on GPS engine by sending AT command “AT+CGPSPWR=1”
User can power down GPS engine by sending AT command “AT+CGPSPWR=0”
